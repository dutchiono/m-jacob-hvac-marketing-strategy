## 3. Local Directories: ROI Analysis

### Cost & Performance Comparison

| Platform | Cost Per Lead | Lead Sharing | Conversion Rate | True Cost Per Customer | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Google LSAs** | $40-$85 | Exclusive | 30-50% | $80-$283 | **PRIORITY** |
| **Angi (Angie's List)** | $25-$120 | 3-5 contractors | 10-16% | $156-$1,200 | Limited Use |
| **Thumbtack** | $10-$75 | 3-5 contractors | 10-30% | $33-$750 | Limited Use |
| **HomeAdvisor** | $25-$120 | 3-5 contractors | 18% | $139-$667 | Limited Use |

### The Platform Cost Reality

**Key Finding:** Average home services lead now costs **$91** across paid channels (up 10.5% annually).

**The Shared Lead Problem:**
- Angi, Thumbtack, and HomeAdvisor sell the same lead to 3-5 contractors
- Only 1 out of 5 contractors will close each lead
- 70% of Angi leads reportedly don't answer or aren't qualified
- True customer acquisition cost: $100-$250+ after factoring low close rates

**Lead Quality Issues:**
- Longer buyer journey (5.5 touchpoints before conversion)
- Price-shopping customers (less loyal)
- Lower intent than Google search leads
- Platform dependency (customers loyal to platform, not your brand)

### Recommended Directory Strategy

**TIER 1 - Essential:**
- **Google Local Services Ads:** Primary platform
  - Disputable leads (refund if unqualified)
  - Google Guarantee badge (trust factor)
  - Higher close rate due to search intent
  - Investment: $1,800-$3,600/month

**TIER 2 - Selective/Test:**
- **Angi:** Test with $400-$600/month budget
  - Monitor close rate closely
  - Require 16%+ conversion to remain profitable
  - Track actual revenue, not just lead count
  
- **Thumbtack:** Test with $300-$500/month budget
  - Lower initial cost but also lower quality
  - Works better for maintenance than emergency
  
- **HomeAdvisor:** Test with $400-$600/month budget
  - Historically better conversion (18%) than competitors
  - Monitor for lead quality degradation

**TIER 3 - Free Listings Only:**
- Yelp (free business listing)
- Better Business Bureau (accreditation valuable)
- Local Pittsburgh directories
- Chamber of Commerce listing

### Directory Success Factors

**To maximize ROI on any directory:**
1. **Response speed:** Respond within 5 minutes (100x more likely to connect than 30 minutes)
2. **Track true cost:** Calculate cost per actual customer, not cost per lead
3. **Dispute aggressively:** Challenge unqualified leads immediately
4. **Set spending limits:** Don't let costs spiral in competitive periods
5. **Review monthly:** Kill underperforming platforms ruthlessly

**Critical Metrics to Track:**
- Lead volume
- Response time
- Contact rate (% of leads you actually reach)
- Quote rate (% of contacts you quote)
- Close rate (% of quotes that become customers)
- Revenue per customer
- True cost per acquisition

## 4. Traditional Media: Radio & Print

### Pittsburgh Radio Market Analysis

#### Market Overview
- **Market size:** 2.6 million population (Pittsburgh DMA)
- **Average 30-second spot:** $88
- **Reach:** Significant but declining with younger demographics

#### Top Pittsburgh Stations for HVAC Advertising

**Talk/News Format (Best for HVAC):**
- **KDKA-AM 1020 / 101.1 FM** - News, talk, traffic, weather
  - Audience: Adults 35-64, higher income
  - Best time: Morning drive (6-9 AM), afternoon drive (3-6 PM)
  
- **WPGP 1250 AM** "The Answer" - News/Talk
  - Audience: Adults 45-65, homeowners
  
- **WJAS 1320 AM** - News/Talk
  - Audience: Adults 50+, established homeowners

**Why Talk Radio Works for HVAC:**
- Older demographic (more likely homeowners)
- Higher household income
- Listen during commute (can call immediately)
- Local weather/traffic = HVAC awareness

#### Radio Advertising Cost Structure

**Production Costs:**
- Professional 30-second spot: $300-$800 one-time
- Voice talent: $150-$300
- Music/sound effects: $100-$200

**Airtime Costs (Pittsburgh Market):**
- **Prime time (morning/afternoon drive):** $150-$300 per spot
- **Midday:** $75-$150 per spot
- **Overnight:** $40-$80 per spot

**Typical Campaign Investment:**
- Minimum effective frequency: 21 spots per week (3x daily reach)
- Weekly cost: $1,500-$4,000
- Monthly cost: $6,000-$16,000

#### Radio Effectiveness for HVAC

**Pros:**
- Builds brand recognition and authority
- Reaches older homeowners effectively
- Creates "top-of-mind awareness" for future needs
- Local credibility (supporting local radio)

**Cons:**
- Difficult to track ROI precisely
- Expensive compared to digital channels
- Declining listenership among younger demographics
- Not as targetable as digital advertising

**Industry Data:**
- 30% of consumers patronize businesses after seeing Facebook ad
- Radio effectiveness declining, especially for younger buyers
- Better for brand building than direct response

### Recommended Radio Strategy

**Tier 1 - Seasonal Brand Building (Budget Permitting):**
Only use radio if you have $6,000-$10,000/month to dedicate to it.

**When to advertise:**
- **4 weeks before summer** (May): "Get your AC ready"
- **4 weeks before winter** (October): "Don't let your furnace fail"
- **During extreme weather:** Emergency service availability

**What to promote:**
- Limited-time tune-up specials
- Emergency 24/7 service availability
- Financing options for new systems
- "Serving Pittsburgh for [X] years"

**Format:**
- 30-second spots
- Include phone number (repeat 3 times)
- Website URL
- Unique tracking number for radio calls

**Example Script:**
"When your furnace breaks down at midnight in Pittsburgh, who do you call? M. Jacob Company has been serving Pittsburgh homeowners for [X] years with 24/7 emergency HVAC service. Right now, schedule your fall furnace tune-up and save $50. That's M. Jacob Company, call 412-XXX-XXXX. Again, 412-XXX-XXXX."

**Tier 2 - Skip Radio, Invest in Digital:**
For most HVAC companies with limited budgets, skipping radio entirely and investing those dollars in Google Ads and SEO will produce better measurable ROI.

### Local Print & Publications

**Pittsburgh-Specific Opportunities:**
- Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (declining readership, expensive)
- Community newsletters (varies by neighborhood)
- Local coupon mailers (Valpak, Money Mailer)
- Homeowner association newsletters

**Recommendation:** Skip traditional print. Instead:
- Invest in neighborhood-specific Facebook ads
- Create Nextdoor business profile (free, neighborhood-based)
- Sponsor local community events (better ROI for local visibility)
